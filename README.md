Chapter 12 (Page 17 through 19)

Purpose: This assignment provides experience with memory mapped files.

Create (use any editor) a text file with a couple sentences in it. Call the file mmap.txt.

Write a program that opens and memory maps that file. Then the program should repeat the following steps 3 times:

<ol>

 <li>ask the user which position in the file they want to change.</li>

 <li>ask the user what the new letter is for that position.</li>

 <li>modify the file (using the memory map).</li>

</ol>

Then the file should be unmapped and closed.

Examine the file (use any editor) and make sure the changes occurred.

Demo: Your mmap program. The instructor will test different inputs.
